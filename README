Just a simple little script which grabs your Twitter favorites and displays a random one to standard output.

To run:

python showmefavs.py [Twitter username]

It doesn't do any sorts of authentication so if your account is private, you won't be able to use it yet.

Hopefully I can add some hooks for Growl or something similar to periodically pop these up.
